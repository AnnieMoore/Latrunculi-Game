# Latrunculi-Game
This allows the user to play Latrunculi, a popular game in the Roman Republic that is similar to chess. Majority of the code is based on the tutorial in https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-chess-game-using-pygame-in-python and https://github.com/x4nth055/pythoncode-tutorials/tree/master/gui-programming/chess-game

To install and play this game on your computer, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Download the code on this page by clicking code, then download zip

2. The zip file should now be in your download folder. Unpack this file by double clicking on it.

3. Open up the terminal on your computer. For Macs, you can search terminal in your spotlight search and click on the first result.

4. Move to the directory that contains the code to start the game. 

    4a. For 2 player (black and white choose their own moves): If the file is saved in your downloads folder, you want to get there in your terminal by typing cd downloads/Roman_games.
    
    4b. For 1-ish player (need to pick the black piece to move, but the move it makes is randomly chosen. I don't think that it can currently capture a white piece on its own, so this is probably a good version to practice strategy!): If the file is saved in your downloads folder, you want to get there in your terminal by typing cd downloads/Roman_games_random_moves.

5. Start the game by typing python main.py into your terminal

6. You can now play the game! I have not been able to set it up so that one player is the computer, so it is currently a two player game. The first player to collect 5 pieces wins!
